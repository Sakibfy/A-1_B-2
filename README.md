ðŸŽ¯ TypeScript Insights: Understanding keyof and any | unknown | never Types
TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, offers powerful static typing features that improve code safety, readability, and maintainability. In this post, weâ€™ll explore two important TypeScript concepts often discussed in interviews: the keyof keyword and the differences between any, unknown, and never.

ðŸ”‘ 1. What is the Use of the keyof Keyword in TypeScript?
The keyof keyword is used to extract the property names (keys) of a given type as a union of string literal types.

âœ… Why Use keyof?
It provides a way to write safer, more generic functions by ensuring only valid property names are used.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
ts
Copy
Edit
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  isActive: boolean;
};

function getValue<T, K extends keyof T>(obj: T, key: K): T[K] {
  return obj[key];
}

const person: Person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  isActive: true,
};

const personName = getValue(person, "name"); // string
const personAge = getValue(person, "age");   // number
Here, K extends keyof T ensures that the key parameter is one of the actual keys of the object type T. This reduces bugs and improves developer experience with better autocompletion and type checking.

ðŸš« 2. Difference Between any, unknown, and never in TypeScript
Understanding these three fundamental types helps avoid unsafe code and improves type safety.

ðŸ“Œ any â€” Turn Off Type Checking
Use Case: When you want to opt-out of type checking.

Behavior: Disables all TypeScript safety.

ts
Copy
Edit
let value: any = 42;
value = "hello";        // No error
value.someMethod();     // No error at compile time, but will crash at runtime
ðŸ”´ Risk: any defeats the purpose of using TypeScript.

ðŸ“Œ unknown â€” Safe Alternative to any
Use Case: When a valueâ€™s type isnâ€™t known at declaration but you donâ€™t want to lose type safety.

Behavior: Requires type checking before usage.

ts
Copy
Edit
let input: unknown = "test";

if (typeof input === "string") {
  console.log(input.toUpperCase()); // Safe
}
âœ… Benefit: Encourages proper type checking and prevents runtime errors.

ðŸ“Œ never â€” Represents the Impossible
Use Case: For functions that never return (e.g., they throw or loop forever).

Behavior: Indicates unreachable code or failure scenarios.

ts
Copy
Edit
function throwError(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}
It also appears in exhaustive checks:

ts
Copy
Edit
type Shape = "circle" | "square";

function handleShape(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape) {
    case "circle":
      // ...
      break;
    case "square":
      // ...
      break;
    default:
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape; // Error if a new case is added
  }
}
âœ… Benefit: Guarantees your code handles all possible cases.

ðŸ§  Final Thoughts
keyof improves generic function safety by narrowing inputs to known keys.

Understanding the differences between any, unknown, and never is crucial for writing safe, predictable TypeScript code.
